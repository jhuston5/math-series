I build an app with a direct and powerful purpose. It does all of the things that it accomplishes well. I should describe the purpose and functionality so those that visit my README understand the app

I worked with Bionca Bond, Chris Rarig, and Ian Cargill to finish this lab. Solving the Fibonacci and Lucas problems were simple solutions but still somewhat difficult for me. The sum_series function was extremely hard. Talking through with the group helped me understand that the structure of the problems were still very similar, but the x and y integers were necessary to call at the end of the recursion stack to finish with the correct answer.
